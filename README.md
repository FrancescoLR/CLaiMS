# Multiple sclerosis cortical lesion detection with deep learning at ultra-high-field MRI
This is the code repository of the NMR in Biomedicine [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4730).

## Overview
This software provide a cortical lesion (CL) segmentation and classification given 7T MP2RAGE images. The code is build upon [MONAI](https://monai.io/) and it is based on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). A GPU is required to train the network with new data, whereas a LINUX machine is sufficient for inference.
